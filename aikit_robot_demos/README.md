# Aikit Robot Demos

We provide a simple set of interactive demos for the Aikit Robot library.
Running these demos is quick and simple.

## Install

First, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft/robot.git ~/aikit_robot
```

The interactive demos optionally make use of the simulator
[CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/),
and the python wrapper [PyRep](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep).

If these are not installed, the demos will all still run, displaying pre-rendered images from the simultator.

### Local

For a local installation, first install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/aikit_robot
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ~/aikit_robot/aikit_robot_demos
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run interactive demos inside a simulator, CoppeliaSim and PyRep should then be installed following the installation [intructions](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep#install).

### Docker

For a docker installation, first ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) are installed.

Then simply pull the aikit robot image:

```bash
docker pull khulnasoft/aikit-robot:latest
```

## Demos

All demos can be run by executing the python scripts directly.
If a demo script is run without command line arguments, then a random backend framework will be selected from those installed.
Alternatively, the `--framework` argument can be used to manually specify a framework from the options
`jax`, `tensorflow`, `torch`, `mxnet` or `numpy`.

The examples below assume a docker installation, but the demo scripts can also
be run with python directly for local installations.

### Run Through

For a basic run through the library:

```bash
cd ~/aikit_robot/aikit_robot_demos
./run_demo.sh run_through
```

This script, and the various parts of the library, are further discussed in the [Run Through](https://github.com/khulnasoft/robot#run-through) section of the main README.
We advise following along with this section for maximum effect. The demo script should also be opened locally,
and breakpoints added to step in at intermediate points to further explore.

To run the script using a specific backend, tensorflow for example, then run like so:

```bash
./run_demo.sh run_through --framework tensorflow
```

### Drone Spline Planning

In this demo, a drone represented by the aikit_robot.RigidModile class is instantiated with starting and target poses,
and both methods aikit_robot.sample_spline_path and RigidModile.sample_body are used.
Combined, these enable gradient-based motion planning, in a scene represented by cuboidal signed distance functions.

```bash
cd ~/aikit_robot/aikit_robot_demos
./run_demo.sh interactive.drone_spline_planning
```

Example output from the simulator is given below:

</p>

### Manipulator Spline Planning

In this demo, a manipulator represented by the aikit_robot.Manipulator class is
instantiated with starting and target joint positions, and both methods aikit_robot.sample_spline_path
and Manipulator.sample_links are used. Combined, these enable gradient-based motion planning,
in a scene represented by cuboidal signed distance functions.

```bash
cd ~/aikit_robot/aikit_robot_demos
./run_demo.sh interactive.manipulator_spline_planning
```
Example output from the simulator is given below:
